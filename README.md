# Icebergs Extractor
## Readme
http://iceber.gs/ was a great bookmarker. But unfortunately they closed.

I had a json export but didn't had the time to give it a look until I met this project : https://github.com/Dissimilis/BookmarksManager

So I developed this extractor to convert the json into an html page that I could browse and choose the links I want to keep.

Maybe it can help somebody else...
